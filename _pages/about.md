Hello, my name is Tobiloba Adaramati.

I am a Data Analytics Consultant.

As a Data Analytics Consultant, I provide decision-support solutions to my clients. As part of my role, I liaise with clients regarding their business problems, collect and analyse internal and external data, create visuals, produce insightful reports to be disseminated to shareholders and recommend strategies for business optimization based on the results of the analysis. 

Before my current role, I have worked in the health systems strengthening sector providing monitoring and evaluation expertise to help improve and track HIV/AIDS patient outcomes; and established matrix for target sharing among facilities to monitor and improve facilitiesâ€™ performance indicators. My latest project involves the systematic review of evidence-based data regarding ARV drugs.

With more than 4 years of experience, I have worked in the health, regional planning, agribusiness industry, and academia both nationally and internationally (USA and UK). I love researching, querying and analyzing data to study the existing patterns, and extract insights that addresses specific questions. I constantly devote my time to studying and attempting projects I find interesting. My aim is to help others learn data analytics through thr information provided on my portfolio.
